"but I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising nice 
was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual te
achings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No on
e rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those 
who donotknow how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely 
painful. Nor again is there anyonewho loves or pursues or desires to obtain nice of itself, 
because it is nice, but because ccasionally circumstances occur in which toil and nice can 
procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes 
laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? but who has any right 
to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, 
or one who avoids a nice that produces no resultant pleasure?
